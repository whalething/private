## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML is used for the structure of the website that you're creaing. The thing that doesn't yet make sense is how to effectively use classes and ID's.. When is it appropriate to do so?

The good thing about HTML is that while formatting the style of the site it helps to be able to do multiple "structures" or elements. The simplistic nature of the language is a a big bonus. 

An 'aha' moment I had was when I was reading up about linking the CSS file to the HTML file. It cleared up how the browser puts the files together and runs the commands.
