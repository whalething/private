I never knew the difference between a website and a webapp. But now it totally makes sense! Web apps are interactive applications that run inside a browser. A website is just a static page limited to HTML/CSS.

Some important things to remeber when setting up your HTML site is to make sure you push the changes that you've made. 

Well the first time I navigated to the site I actually got a 404 Error and was instantly worried where I went wrong. I was a little nervous about the potential rabbit hole that I was about to go down. Luckily, it was just Github taking a bit of time reflecting the changes that I had made. I was pretty stoked after I saw it live. 

The one "aha" moment that I had was when I read the Internet vs. Web article. I never understood the difference and I can now see how the Web is just built on top of the internet.
