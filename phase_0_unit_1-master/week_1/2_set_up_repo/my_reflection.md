## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) Hit the plus button right next you your username on the top right of GitHub and hit create New Repository. 
2) Name the repository.  And under 'license' choose the MIT license
3) Open GitHub client on the mac, Choose your GitHub username on the left, and hit "clone to computer" for the repo you just created
4) Dance.

Open source basically means that any programmer can modify or change the code for personal use. Generally when a program is released for use the public doesn't have access to the source code. Open source means that a programmer has access to the source and can modify the code to change the behavior of the program.

I think open source is awesome! In a way it seems utopian but I don't necessarily think that every program or project needs to be open source. Would the Adobe Suite  or iOS exist without the financial incentive? There are some projects where open source makes sense and others where it doesn't.

Obviously licensing is critical for a fair market. It help give credit where it's due. You wouldn't want you hard-work to go unnoticed or have someone else pretend it was them. Licensing helps give permission to the right people. "right" meaning the people that you can specify...=D

The concept that was solidified in this challenge was definitely open source. I had a vague intuitive understanding of what it was. But reading that article about open source finally defined exactly what it was. Especially the tid bit about a programmer having access to the source code.
