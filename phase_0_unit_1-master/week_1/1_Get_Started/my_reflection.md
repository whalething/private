## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

For some reason git was already installed on my Mac even though I had never used it before..
I looked over the tutorial on how to do it and what I didn't understand was the SSH stuff? 

I'm a big fan of google drive and have used it many times in the past to collaborate. I like to think
of the git/GitHub relationship like that. Let's assume that the final version of an essay is always stored on google drive (You're working on this essay with multiple people). 
So google drive is equivalent to GitHub in the sense that the final version will be stored there. You work on the parts of the essay locally on your machine and once you think it's ready you can "push" it to the drive. Git is a program that helps you easily communicate with google Drive.

Version Control is exactly what the name implies.. It's the idea that as you are working on a project it is useful to keep track of the changes that you make. Github helps you with this because as you progress through a project you can keep older versions of it saved on GitHub. 

Developers use git because it's an effective way to make changes to a project. It's effective because you can work on without screwing up what you already have. You can push your changes after you know that it works. 

The part that doesn't make sense is the ability to fork something on GitHub. What is the purpose of that? Is it just so anyone can work on a project and not be a part of it? Just a hunch.
